# my_advent_of_code_solutions
Here you can find my solutions to the programming puzzles of [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/).

Thanks to Eric Wastl for creating these interesting puzzles for us all to solve.

In his FAQ (https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) he requested: "If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs." Therefore you need to add your own input files, or not much will happend besides an error that the missing file couldn't be opened.
